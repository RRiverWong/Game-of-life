# Game-of-life
Game of Life Simulation

Description

This project is an interactive implementation of Conway’s Game of Life, written in Processing. The simulation incorporates additional features, such as cell aging, random naming, and survival mechanics, to create a dynamic and engaging experience. The user can interact with the simulation to create, remove, or reset cells and pause the game to explore its behavior.

Features
	•	Cell Aging and Colors: Cells change color based on their age, representing different life stages.
	•	Named Cells: Each cell has a randomly assigned name, displayed in the console when born or when it dies.
	•	Survival Rules: Cells follow Conway’s rules, with additional mechanics for survival failure:
	•	Cells that fail to survive for 3 consecutive steps automatically die.
	•	Dead cells can be revived when surrounded by exactly 3 neighbors.
	•	User Interaction:
	•	Pause the game and manually toggle cells on or off with a mouse click.
	•	Reset the grid with new random cells.
	•	Clear all cells or pause the game with keyboard shortcuts.

 Controls
	•	Mouse:
	•	Click on cells when paused to toggle their state (alive or dead).
	•	Keyboard:
	•	Press R to reset the grid with random live cells.
	•	Press C to clear all cells.
	•	Press SPACE to pause or resume the simulation.

 How to Run
	1.	Download and Install Processing:
	•	Download Processing from Processing.org.
	•	Install the application on your computer.
	2.	Set Up the Project:
	•	Download the .pde file(s) and place them in a single folder.
	•	Open the main .pde file in Processing.
	3.	Run the Simulation:
	•	Click the Run button in the Processing IDE to start the program.
	•	Follow the on-screen instructions to begin interacting with the simulation.
